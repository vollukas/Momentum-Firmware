# Momentum FW JavaScript SDK Wizard
This package contains an interactive wizard that lets you scaffold a JavaScript
application for Flipper Zero using the Momentum Firmware JS SDK.

This is a fork of the [Official Flipper Zero JS SDK Wizard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flipperdevices/create-fz-app),
configured to use the [Momentum JavaScript SDK]((https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next-flip/fz-sdk-mntm)) instead.
No other changes are included.

## Getting started
Create your application using the interactive wizard:
```shell
npx @next-flip/create-fz-app-mntm@latest
```

Then, enter the directory with your application and launch it:
```shell
cd my-flip-app
npm start
```

You are free to use `pnpm` or `yarn` instead of `npm`.
